    script: `[SLIDE 1 - OPENER]\nHi Robert, thanks for taking a few minutes to watch this. I put this together specifically for Sysco because I know managing 500+ distribution centers with on-time delivery expectations from your restaurant clients is no small feat.\n\n[SLIDE 2 - THE PAIN]\nHere's what we're seeing across food distributors your size: detention and demurrage costs averaging $1,200 per container, OTIF rates stuck below 85%, and safety stock levels 20-30% higher than they need to be — all because systems don't talk to each other in real-time.\n\nAt Balboa, we track 92 in-transit shipments in real-time right now, and our platform flagged 801 delayed shipments this week alone — before they became customer-facing problems.\n\n[SLIDE 3 - HOW NAUTA WORKS]\nBalboa sits on top of your existing SAP and Manhattan WMS. We don't replace anything — we synchronize everything. Real-time tracking, automated PO management with 250+ active purchase orders, inventory optimization showing $9.1M on-hand with smart safety stock recommendations, and even Section 301 tariff exposure monitoring.\n\n[SLIDE 4 - ROI]\nFor a distributor Sysco's size, we typically see: 0.25% fill rate improvement translating to $15M+ in recovered revenue, 18% safety stock reduction freeing $180M+ in working capital, and a 92% reduction in emergency POs.\n\n[SLIDE 5 - NEXT STEPS]\nI'd love to show you a live 20-minute demo tailored to Sysco's specific distribution network. Would next Tuesday or Wednesday work? I'll have our food distribution specialist on the call too.`,
